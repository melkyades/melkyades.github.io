<div class="message" markdown="1">
  I am a fan of high-level low-level programming.
  I've been *successfully* mixing Smalltalk and assembly code for more than a decade.

  Today's high-level, dynamic programming languages are run on top of highly-complex virtual machines... so complex that the VMs themselves deserve being developed with
  high-level dynamic tools too!
  
  Within Bee Smalltalk, SqueakNOS and now [Egg Smalltalk](https://github.com/powerlang/egg) projects I have been trying to make live-programming of system-level concerns like VMs more practical to application programmers.

  I currently work for Labware and Quorum Software, where I apply my expertise to real-world challenges while pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Buenos Aires University, where I occasionally do teaching.
