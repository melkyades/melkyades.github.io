<div class="message" markdown="1">
  I am a fan of high-level low-level programming.
  I've been *successfully* mixing Smalltalk and assembly code for more than a decade.

  Today's high-level, dynamic programming languages are run on top of highly-complex virtual machines... so complex that the VMs themselves started deserving to be developed with
  high-level dynamic tools too!
  
  Within Bee Smalltalk, SqueakNOS and [Powerlang](https://github.com/powerlang/powerlang) projects I have been trying to make live-programming of Virtual Machines more practical to application programmers.
  
  I work at Quorum Software while also pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Buenos Aires University, where I occasionally do teaching.
